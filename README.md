# FCC WORKS 

Welcome to my collection of mini-projects built while learning through **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)**!  
This repo is my personal coding playground — a place to try, fail, learn, and create as I grow my frontend skills.

Each folder contains a small project focused on basic web dev concepts like HTML, CSS, and responsive layouts.
